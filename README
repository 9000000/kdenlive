Kdenlive is a video editing application for KDE.

This is a the first KDE4 release. Please check the
project page for more information, and to report new bugs.

To use Kdenlive, you will need to download and install MLT, available from
the following webpage :

This version of Kdenlive requires MLT version 0.3.2. It may work with different 
versions, but this is not guaranteed, or (at this stage of development) likely.
