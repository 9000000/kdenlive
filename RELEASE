Before the release
    Discover page
        Add blog entries to the discover page (http://kdenlive.org/discover/0.8 but with updated version number).
        Add the changelog as well.

    The dot
        Prepare an article for http://dot.kde.org/ (may take some days until it is accepted) (they say)

    Freeze
        About two weeks before a new release feature and string freeze will be introduced. This allows:
        * Translators to translate Kdenlive everything on time. (Strings must not be changed anymore
          in the source code, otherwise the translators would have to fix it again and so on.)
        * Testers on finding remaining bugs
        * Developers to focus on bug fixing (and not introducing new bugs with new features)

    Testers
        Ideally mobilize as many testers as possible to find remaining bugs before the version is released!

After the release
    Mantis
        Close all entries that have been resolved in this release.
